/**
 * Canonical catalog of gateable product modules + industry sectors.
 *
 * Module keys ARE the top-level sidebar nav ids (src/components/layouts/nav-config.ts),
 * so an entitlement allowlist lines up 1:1 with the IA. `overview` and `settings`
 * are FIXED (the fixed anchors of the nav, FIXED_NAV_IDS there) — always on, never
 * gateable. Sectors mirror the seeded industry verticals (prisma/seed/sectors/*).
 *
 * Enforcement (nav + API/proxy) is Foundation Plan 3; this file is the shared
 * vocabulary both the data layer (here) and the enforcement layer (later) read.
